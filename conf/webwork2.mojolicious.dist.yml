# Setting MIN_HTML_ERRORS to 1 will minimize the data provided on HTML error
# pages, which some security reviews request, as in particular the older output
# provided backtrace information which could help idenfify the code and version
# of the code being used on the server.  The useful information will be in the
# Mojolicious webwork2.log file, with a UID displayed also in the HTML error
# page to help match up records.
#
# Warning: The Mojolicious webwork2.log is available to system administrators
# but not to users with staff level accounts in the courses, so using the more
# secure settings requires more cooperation from the system administrators when
# debugging data is needed.
MIN_HTML_ERRORS: 0

# Setting JSON_ERROR_LOG to 1 will change the output format in the Mojolicious
# webwork2.log file to be JSON based, which will make programmatic processing of
# the error reports easier, but can break the functionality of existing scripts
# which parse error.log.

# If a remote site is using this WW server to process WW problems and embed them
# into web pages, the web browser might not permit the WW problems to be
# displayed, as it violates security policy to mix content from different
# origins without an explicit directive from the server that it is safe.
# Uncomment the extra_headers setting as is to set the header to enable
# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for url responses to requests to urls
# that start with /webwork2/webwork_rpc, /webwork2/html2xml, and
# /webwork2_files.  This may be needed to use the client formats if they are
# accessed from a *remote* server.
#
# Note that the /webwork2/html2xml url is deprecated, and code should be adapted
# to use the /webwork2/webwork_rpc path instead.  They both do the same thing
# that the /webwork2/html2xml endpoint did before, but they no longer pass
# through the XMLRPC middle man.
#
# Additional urls may also be added, and multiple headers may be set per url.
# The headers will be added to all responses to urls that start with the url
# given.
